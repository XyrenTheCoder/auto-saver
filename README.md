# auto-saver / auto key clicking tool
Auto saver to prevent unsaved code in case you forgot to save it. Can also be used for auto keybind clicking.

## note
1. too low time intervals may lag if you have a crap pc
2. some keybinds (e.g. ctrl + k, s) is not included and **do not** put these special keybinds in custom due to my skill issue
3. can also do other single keys (e.g. h)
4. red text on the top is being used for debugging
5. i have no idea what i coded inside this thing so please don't complain about the unreadable codes because idek what i wrote
