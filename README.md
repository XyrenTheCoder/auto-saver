# auto-saver / auto key clicking tool
Auto saver to prevent unsaved code in case you forgot to save it. Can also be used for auto keybind clicking.

## note
1. too low time intervals may lag if you have a crap pc
2. some keybinds (e.g. ctrl + k, s) is not included and **do not** put these special keybinds in due to my skill issue
3.
